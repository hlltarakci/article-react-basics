[Under Construction]

# React Basics
When you use MVC which is a popular pattern, so many popular frameworks like Angular rely on, separation of concern is not very well implemented actually. For most of the changes, you have to touch 3 files: js, css and html to make sure everything is consistent with each other. If they are so dependent on each other, why should i separate them in the first place? React is all about components, a component is totally encapsulated. 

React reuses Javascript knowledge, which is wise. Frameworks come and go, but Javascript is here to stay. React provides a simple API, close to human mental modal and do not re-invent the wheel. 

React pays special attention to performance. 


## Prerequisite
React requires basic knowledge of Javascript. Best resources i have ever seen are [javascript.info](https://javascript.info/) which is a meaty tutorial and great if you have enough time and [Re-introduction to Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript) which is a 30-minute tutor and will be beneficial if you have some development background already. I plan to publish a Javascript tutorial very soon emphasizing my point of view, it is still in draft phase.
